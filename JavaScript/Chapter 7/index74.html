<!--
    - API: Application Programming Interface
    - Contract provided by one piece of software to another
    - Structured request and response
    - We just worked with an API that takes a request and responds with jokes

    - REST: Representational State Transfer
    - Architecture style for designing networked applications
    - Relies on a stateless, client-server protocol, almost always HTTP
    - Treats server objects as resources that can be created or destroyed
    - Can be used by any languages
    - All have their own rules and structure

    - GET: Retrieve data from a specified resource
    - POST: Submit data to be processed to a specified resource
    - PUT: Update a specified resource
    - DELETE: Delete a specified resource
    - HEAD: Same as get but does not return a body
    - OPTIONS: Returns supported HTTP methods
    - PATCH: Update partial resources

    GET https://someurl.com/api/users - get all users
    GET https://someurl.com/api/users/1 - get a single user
    POST https://someurl.com/api/users - add user
    PUT https://someurl.com/api/users/1 - update user
    DELETE https://someurl.com/api/users/1 - delete user
